This is the GitHub Repository for my Bachelor's thesis, **Neural network-based modeling and solving of epidemic spreads**.

- `bsc_thesis_code.ipynb` contains the neural networks,  
- `sindy.ipynb` the SINDy models,  
- the rest of the files were used to figure creation,  
- except for `phase3d.py`, which contains an interactive 3d plot of the phase space of the SIR model
